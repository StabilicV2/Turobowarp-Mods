//! This script is to make an option to create a new global block similar to the custom blocks
//! but functions globally rather than locally individually to each sprite.
//? This will require a button to create as many global blocks as requested by the user with all the
//? appropriate features such as the regular custom block. With additionally a few more options. 
    //> Boolean, Variable, Text/Comment, Color


//TODO: Create classes (Class, getInfo, return) and a way to create new blocks globally and
//TODO: associate them with their own header definition for all sprites

        //* Pseudocode

//ยง Create a function to create a new global block
    //> A function to create a new block definition for all sprites
    //> This will require a button to create global blocks with defenitions
    //ยง appropriate features such as the regular custom block. With additionally a few more options.

This is going to be a collection of Turbowarp extension files ranging from list/variable management to movement and sprite altering extensions.

Movement (General, Blocky) - This is a movement script file for all directions but simply moves N pixels at a time, arrow key support only

Movement (General, Smooth) - This is a movement script file for all directions and animates movement of N steps, but initial step is separate from smooth animated steps (needs to be fixed). Both arrow key and WASD support.

ASCII - Converts input into ASCII

Rounding - Rounds integer with N precision

Power - X to the power of Y

Encode - Encode to Base64, UTF-8 and ASCII

Decode - Decode from Base64, UTF-8 and ASCII

!!Currently the Utilities file only contains ASCII, Power, Rounding, Encoding and Decoding!!

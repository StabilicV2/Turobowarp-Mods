Movement (General, Blocky) - This is a movement script file for all directions but simply moves N pixels at a time, arrow key support only

Movement (General, Smooth) - This is a movement script file for all directions and animates movment of N steps, but initial step is seperate from smooth animated steps (needs to be fixed). Both arrow key and WASD support.
